Apologies, but this notebook must be refreshed in its entirety via RUN ALL for any change no matter how minor. There are many dependencies so DO NOT RELY ON calculating individual cells; to be safest, use CLEAR ALL OUTPUTS.

I recommend using the OUTLINE (Github Codespace) or Table of Contents (in jupyter) view to navigate this notebook. And a wide monitor :)

Out of habit, I tried to modularize my code; however, when the project is limited to a single jupyter notebook, modularization gets fugly quickly b/c of global variable behavior and cell scope. Which is why RUN ALL is necessary.

I make things more difficult by attempting Classification modeling
